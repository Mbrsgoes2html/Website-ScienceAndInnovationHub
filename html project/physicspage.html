    <h1>Physics Mini Hub</h1>
    <p>Physics is the scientific study of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of the universe. It seeks to understand the natural laws that govern the behavior of everything from subatomic particles to galaxies in the cosmos.
 Physics plays a crucial role in our understanding of the world around us and has led to countless technological advancements that shape our modern lives.</p>
<h2>About Scientists</h2>
 <img src="ae.jpg" alt="albert einstein">
<p>Albert Einstein 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,
 widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity,
 he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.
His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation"</p>

<p>Charles Robert Darwin 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology.
 His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science.In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural selection,
 in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27)[a] was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed.
 His pioneering book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal </p>

 <p>Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death,
 was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge,
 widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world</p>
